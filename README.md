#S-PLUS data

###In this repository, you'll discover a method for obtaining images of galaxies in separate or combined filters from the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS).

###The S-PLUS project aims to cover an expansive 9300 square degrees of the sky, providing precise photometric redshifts for objects up to i = 21. Anchored by the T80S telescope, equipped with the T80Cam-S optical imager, the survey employs a 12-filter system, comprising 7 narrow-band filters (J0378, J0395, J0410, J0430, J0515, J0660, J0861) that coincide with, respectively, the OII, Ca H+K, Hδ, G-band, Mgb triplet, Hα and Ca triplet features, and 5 broad-band filters (u, g, r, i, z). Within this codebase, I demonstrate how to retrieve images of S-PLUS objects from a CSV list, utilizing all 12 filters, individually or in combination.

###Before diving into the repository, it's crucial to create a user account and password on https://splus.cloud to gain access to the S-PLUS data. Following this step, I'll guide you through the process of specifying your image search using information about desired objects, provided you have their Right Ascension (RA) and Declination (DEC) coordinates.
